A simple web-based tool built with Gradio that converts `.torrent` files to magnet links.

## Features

- Upload single or multiple `.torrent` files
- Extracts complete metadata including:
  - Info hash (btih)
  - Display name
  - Trackers
  - Web seeds
- Generates properly formatted magnet links
- Easy copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Clean and intuitive web interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Dependencies managed via `uv`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gradio-torrent-tool
```

2. Install dependencies using `uv`:
```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
uv run python app.py
```

The Gradio interface will launch and provide a local URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:7860`). Open this URL in your web browser to access the tool.

### How to use:

1. Click on the file upload area or drag and drop `.torrent` files
2. You can upload multiple torrent files at once
3. Click "Submit" to convert the files
4. The generated magnet links will appear in the output text box
5. Use the copy button to copy the magnet links to your clipboard

## Dependencies

- **gradio** (>=5.31.0) - For the web interface
- **libtorrent** (>=2.0.11) - For parsing torrent files and extracting metadata

## How it works

The tool uses the `libtorrent` library to parse `.torrent` files and extract:
- The info hash (unique identifier for the torrent)
- The torrent name
- All tracker URLs
- Any web seed URLs

This information is then formatted into a standard magnet link format:
```
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:[hash]&dn=[name]&tr=[tracker1]&tr=[tracker2]...
```
